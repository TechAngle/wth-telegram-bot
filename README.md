**Hey there and welcome to the WTH Bot project!**

### Why is this bot?
WTH is an acronym for "Which sensitive To High profanity"; it is a highly anti-profanity bot. Its goal is to keep your discussions tidy by eliminating any offensive language or personalized remarks.

### Getting Started
1. First off, clone the repo with: <code>git clone https://github.com/TechAngle/wtp-telegram-bot</code> 
2. Head over to **@BotFather** on Telegram to create your own bot and grab its token. Then, open up `config.py` and pop that token into the `TOKEN` variable.
3. Write your Telegram id or username in `admin` variable (it will use to contact you)

### How to Use
If you're on Windows, just double-click `run.bat`. Otherwise, follow these steps:
- **Navigate to the project folder.**
- **Activate the virtual environment** by running:<br>
    - `source ./env/Scripts/activate` (Linux)<br>
    - `.\env\Scripts\activate.bar` (Windows)
- Finally, **launch the bot** with:
`python wth.py`
